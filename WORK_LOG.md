This is a solid-ish idea but fails in a lot of edge cases. Not fully sure what changes to make or if an approach like this is feasible. |
| Jna 15  | 2:45-3:30am | Coded a pretty simple algorithm that is O(n^2). It iterates through the temps array, storing the longest valid sequence that ends at each index. The longest sequence that ends at index 0 is 1, and the longest sequence that ends at index i is 1 plus the longest sequence that ends before i with the temperature at j less than the temperature at i. I check all values from 0 to i-1 for every index i, so it's a O(n^2) algorithm. I finish all test cases in about 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, which is fast enough, but I'm still curious about whether a linear-time approach similar to the one I was trying to get work is possible. |
