This is a solid-ish idea but fails in a lot of edge cases. Not fully sure what changes to make or if an approach like this is feasible. |
| Jan 15  |       2:45-3:30am       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Coded a pretty simple algorithm that is O(n^2). It iterates through the temps array, storing the longest valid sequence that ends at each index. The longest sequence that ends at index 0 is 1, and the longest sequence that ends at index i is 1 plus the longest sequence that ends before i with the temperature at j less than the temperature at i. I check all values from 0 to i-1 for every index i, so it's a O(n^2) algorithm. I finish all test cases in about 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, which is fast enough, but I'm still curious about whether a linear-time approach similar to the one I was trying to get work is possible. |

I'm trying to do something where I do a linear pass through the temperatures array and, through some sort of clever reasoning, manage to find the longest sequence starting at that index without having to do linear passes. |

Tried to code something similar to compare the approaches, but I'm only passing like 2 test cases at a time. Not sure what the issue is, have to thoroughly review the code to see where I messed up. |

(To be more accurate, his approach could work, but you're not able to break out of one of the loops early like he'd hoped, meaning the algorithm just goes back to being O(n^2)). I reverted my code back to my old algorithm. |

Talked with Kieran and Noah about possibilities to improve the algorithm and haven't found anything. |

Used an ArrayList of ArrayLists of integers as the adjacency list. Didn't run into any issues or confusion except for a few syntax things that were easy to google/troubleshoot. |
| Jan 23  |       2:30-2:55pm       | Coded an approach with an AdjacencyMatrix. It runs in about 450-600 ms, which is faster than the AdjacencyList (which makes sense bc most of the runtime is in testEfficientLarge which is somewhat dense) but still slower than my original approach where edges are computed as they need to be used instead of being precomputed and stored. This didn't involve much structural change compared to the Adjacency List approach. The only changes are how the matrix is initialized, stored, and checked (which is mostly just substituting ArrayList methods with their array-based counterparts). Then, I put each of the techniques into a different class (my original method stays in WeatherPatterns and is the one that runs when WeatherPatternsTest is ran, because it's the fastest). I also recoded my original method to make it a little more efficient. It now runs in about 140-150 ms. |

Also replaced Integer.max() with Math.max() which makes like no diference. |
